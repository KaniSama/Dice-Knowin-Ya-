DICE KNOWIN' YA
A tiny dumb game made in about 32 hours.

Unfortunately, you got turned into a die and thrown into a pit. Get out and get revenge (or not. revenge isn't in the game).


CONTROLS:
Arrow keys - Movement
E - End your turn
F&nbsp;- Hide overlays
R - Roll the dice (in the Map screen)
Collect soul shards to attack your enemies.

You deal damage based on the number on top of your die when you collect a shard.

Enemies move based on which number is on the top of their dice when their turn begins. When an enemy attacks the player, it deals damage based on how many moves it had left that turn, and loses all its moves for that turn.
